  "description": "The T-2077 watch has been crafted to merge the precise, technological aesthetic of what you’d expect from the latest cyberware with a minimalist veneer which drives home the fact that, to have the edge in the world of 2077, you don’t always have to take it to the extreme.\n\nUnlike military-grade cyberware that is designed to bludgeon, threaten, or manipulate, the T-2077 originates purely from the notion that time is our most powerful weapon. A notion that Błonie, the celebrated Polish watch manufacturer we've teamed up with to create the T-2077, understands very well.\n\nWith the T-2077 on your wrist, you take control as you march forward into the future — one second at a time.\n\nMay it serve you well.",
